# Book Market Project

This is the repository of the Mercado Livro Project, a backend application developed in Kotlin using the Spring Framework. The Mercado Livro Project is a system that demonstrates the use of several modern technologies to build a robust and secure web application, simulating a book sales system.

## Technologies
**Kotlin Programming Language**: The application is written in Kotlin, a modern programming language that is concise, secure, and interoperable with Java.

**Spring Framework with Kotlin**: I used the Spring Framework, one of the most popular frameworks for Java/Kotlin development, to build the base of the application.

**Relational Database - MySQL**: I used MySQL as our relational database to store and manage data efficiently and securely.

**Spring Data**: Spring Data is used to simplify the data access layer, facilitating interaction with MySQL.

**Events**: Spring Events were used to allow communication between different parts of the application in an asynchronous and efficient way.

**Spring Security**: I used Spring Security to ensure the security of our application, managing user authentication and authorization.

**Unit Tests with Mockk**: I wrote unit tests to ensure code quality, using the Mockk library to create mocks and simulate behaviors.
